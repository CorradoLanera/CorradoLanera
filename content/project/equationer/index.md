The goal of the package `{equationer}` is to implement an environment to consistently generate the estimations from the equations reported in the paper “Resting Energy Expenditure in the Elderly: Systematic Review and Comparison of Equations in an Experimental Population” by the Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health of the University of Padova.

A Shiny app is also provided helping clinicians in finding out the most appropriate equation for estimating the REE for each subject.
