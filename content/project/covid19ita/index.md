The goal of `{covid19ita}` is to provide a platform for the monitoring of COVID-19 infection diffusion in Italy.

You can visit the covid19ita Shiny App hosted and running on the UBEP (Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Public Health) servers. You can also run a local version of the app from your computer powered by the `{covid19ita}` package.

The `{covid19ita}` package provide R versions of the three official Italian COVID-19 datasets at national, regional and provincial level of detail.
