Abstract: "To celebrate that I am now an [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) [Certified Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) in the [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/), I will deliver a little-extended version of the lesson I prepared for my exam: \"**(Meta)data texting in [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - an introduction to the usage of text with axes, legends, points, and plots.**\" This thirty-minute hands-on will introduce you to the useful tools available in [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to start exploring in practice how to use text in plots and have the basics for your own in-depth study."
