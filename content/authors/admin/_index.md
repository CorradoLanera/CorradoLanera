My research activity is driven in the area of machine learning
and phenomapping techniques applied to clinical settings, with
particular attention to free-text and unstructured data analyses
and classification of:

  - patients, based on free-text fields of electronic health records
    
  - papers and clinical registries' entries taylored on researchers'
    interest, supporting systematic review and meta-analysis processes
  
  - wearable devices' kinetic signals, for caloric intake and
    rehabilitation rate/quality estimation
