Corrado Lanera is a third year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the
department of Cardiac, Thoracic, Vascoular Sciences and Public Helath of
the University of Padova (Italy). His research activity is driven in the
area of Machine Learning (ML) and Phenomapping techniques applied to
clinical science.

He puts particular attention to free-text and unstructured data analyses
on:

  1) patient classification with or without reported infections based on
     free-text fields of the Electronic Health Records
    
  2) classification of papers and clinical registries' entries driven by
     researcher interest, to support the Systematic Review and
     Meta-Analysis processes
  
  3) caloric intake estimation from wearable devices' kinetic signals
     
  4) patients pre- vs post-surgical rehabilitation rate/quality from
     wearable devices' kinetic signals.
