I have been an R enthusiast and data scientist since 2014 and passionate about the Tidyverse since its beginning. Currently, I am a post-doc at the [UBEP](https://www.dctv.unipd.it/dipartimento/strutture/biostatistica) at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/). There, my research activity is driven in the area of machine learning and phenomapping techniques applied to clinical settings, with
particular attention to free-text and unstructured data analyses
and classification of:

  - patients based on free-text fields of electronic health records
    
  - papers and clinical registries' entries tailored on researchers'
    interest, supporting systematic review and meta-analysis processes
  
  - wearable devices' kinetic signals, for caloric intake and
    rehabilitation rate/quality estimation


For our unit, I also manage the RStudio Pro and Shiny Open servers for the development and deployment of [results, services, and apps](https://r-ubesp.dctv.unipd.it/) we offer.


I love promoting, teaching, and being an example of how to create human-readable, reproducible, and robust R code, and I am recently became a [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) [Certified Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/lanera+corrado/) in the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). ![](img/CertifiedRstudioTrainer.png)
