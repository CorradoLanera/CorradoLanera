title: "Use of Machine Learning Techniques for Case-Detection of
Varicella Zoster Using Routinely Collected Textual Ambulatory Records:
Pilot Observational Study "

abstract: "**Background**: The detection of infectious diseases through
the analysis of free text on electronic health reports (EHRs) can
provide prompt and accurate background information for the
implementation of preventative measures, such as advertising and
monitoring the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.

**Objective**: The purpose of this paper is to compare machine learning
techniques in their application to EHR analysis for disease detection.

**Methods**: The Pedianet database was used as a data source for a
real-world scenario on the identification of cases of varicella. The
models’ training and test sets were based on two different Italian
regions’ (Veneto and Sicilia) data sets of 7631 patients and 1,230,355
records, and 2347 patients and 569,926 records, respectively, for whom a
gold standard of varicella diagnosis was available. Elastic-net
regularized generalized linear model (GLMNet), maximum entropy (MAXENT),
and LogitBoost (boosting) algorithms were implemented in a supervised
environment and 5-fold cross-validated. The document-term matrix
generated by the training set involves a dictionary of 1,871,532 tokens.
The analysis was conducted on a subset of 29,096 tokens, corresponding
to a matrix with no more than a 99% sparsity ratio.

**Results**: The highest predictive values were achieved through
boosting (positive predicative value [PPV] 63.1, 95% CI 42.7-83.5 and
negative predicative value [NPV] 98.8, 95% CI 98.3-99.3). GLMNet
delivered superior predictive capability compared to MAXENT (PPV 24.5%
and NPV 98.3% vs PPV 11.0% and NPV 98.0%). MAXENT and GLMNet predictions
weakly agree with each other (agreement coefficient 1 [AC1]=0.60, 95% CI
0.58-0.62), as well as with LogitBoost (MAXENT: AC1=0.64, 95% CI
0.63-0.66 and GLMNet: AC1=0.53, 95% CI 0.51-0.55).

**Conclusions**: Boosting has demonstrated promising performance in
large-scale EHR-based infectious disease identification."
