title: "Consumers’ attitudes before and after the introduction of the Chilean regulation on food labelling"

abstract: "The aim of the present study is to understand how the attitudes towards food labelling in the Chilean population have changed after the introduction of the Chilean law on food labelling and advertising. A computer-assisted telephone interview was conducted in 2012 and 2016, employing the same procedures. The difference in outcomes between 2012 and 2016 was assessed using a logistic regression model. One hundred and sixty-seven subjects responded to both the 2012 and 2016 survey editions (respondents). For both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, the respondents in 2016 were more likely to be involved in a programme to lose weight and to consider food labelling the most effective intervention introduced to date to promote healthy nutrition. However, no significant differences were reported in both self-reported and objectively assessed understandings of front-of-pack-labelling. Evidence suggests a positive perception among Chileans regarding the effectiveness of the new law."
