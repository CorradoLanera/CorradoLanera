title: "Is a more aggressive COVID-19 case detection approach mitigating the burden on ICUs? Some reflections from Italy"

abstract: "Italy is the first European country in which the COVID-19
epidemic outbreak has spread, starting from two regions in Northern
Italy, Veneto, and Lombardia. The outbreak poses a relevant burden on
hospital resources, with a marked increase in the intensive care unit
(ICU) occupancy rates. It has been hypothesized that the proportion
of severe infections that need intensive care could be affected by the
testing strategy. At the beginning of the epidemic outbreak (21
February), an extensive testing strategy of both symptomatic and
asymptomatic subjects has been adopted in Veneto and Lombardia. However,
soon after the starting of the outbreak (27 February), the Italian
Ministry of Health introduced restrictions in testing asymptomatic/mild
symptomatic subjects. Such a recommendation has been a topic of debate
among Italian scientists and policymakers since it has been suggested
that also asymptomatic patients seem to transmit the infection. For
this reason, different strategies have been adopted at the regional
level, thanks to the local autonomy of the regional health services. The
Lombardia region adopted the recommendation, while the Veneto
region did not apply the restrictions in testing asymptomatic/mild symp-
tomatic patients, in line with the strategy adopted by the Republic
of Korea. To compare such two testing strategies, we assessed the
relationship between the percentage of ICU admissions on the resident
population and the percentage of asymptomatic/mild symptomatic subjects
tested on the resident population, in Lombardia and Veneto. Analyses are
based on official data. The asymptomatic/mild symptomatic subjects
tested were obtained by subtracting the daily number of newly
hospitalized patients from the total number of tests performed on the
same day. The choice of asymptomatic patients instead of the overall
number of patients was performed to avoid artifactual collinearity in
the two dimensions being analyzed. Smoothing approximation using a
loess regression method using polynomials of degree 2 with the alpha
parameter set to 1.5 has been fitted. The results are reported in
Fig. 1. At the beginning of the observation (24 February), the
percentage of asymptomatic/mild symptomatic subjects tested was 0.014%
in Lombardia and 0.044% in Veneto, with 0.00019% and 0.00008% ad-
missions in ICU in Lombardia and Veneto, respectively. At the 27th of
March, the asymptomatic/mild symptomatic subjects tested were 0.83% in
Lombardia and 1.66% in Veneto, with 0.01283% and 0.00689% of subjects
admitted to the ICU in Lombardia and Veneto, respectively. Such data
show a higher percentage of asymptomatic/mild symptomatic subjects
tested since the beginning of the outbreak in Veneto, corresponding to a
lower percentage of subjects admitted to the ICU. These findings suggest
that testing also asymptomatic/ mild symptomatic patients would help
reduce the proportion of most severe cases eventually requiring ICU
and thus limiting the risk of saturation of ICU units. "
