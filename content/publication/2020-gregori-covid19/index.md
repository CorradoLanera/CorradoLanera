title: "A first estimation of the impact of public health actions
against COVID-19 in Veneto (Italy)"

abstract: "
**Background** Veneto is one of the first Italian regions where the
COVID-19 outbreak started spreading. Containment measures were approved
soon thereafter. The present study aims at providing a first look at the
impact of the containment measures on the outbreak progression in the
Veneto region, Italy.

**Methods** A Bayesian changepoint analysis was used to identify the
changing speed of the epidemic curve. Then, a piecewise polynomial model
was considered to fit the data in the first period before the detected
changepoint. In this time interval, that is, the weeks from 27 February
to 12 March, a quadratic growth was identified by a generalised additive
model (GAM). Finally, the model was used to generate the projection of
the expected number of hospitalisations at 2 weeks based on the epidemic
speed before the changepoint. Such estimates were then compared with the
actual outbreak behaviour.

**Results** The comparison between the observed and predicted
hospitalisation curves highlights a slowdown on the total COVID-19
hospitalisations after the onset of containment measures. The estimated
daily slowdown effect of the epidemic growth is estimated as 78
hospitalisations per day as of 27 March (95% CI 75 to 81).

**Conclusions** The containment strategies seem to have positively
impacted the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Veneto."

epidemic outbreak in Italy reported and estimated from 24 February to 27
March. Panel 2 The number of avoided COVID-19 hospitalised cases in the
Veneto region compared with the trend expected as of 12 March. Panel 3
Days of delay estimated by taking the difference between the days needed
to achieve an equal level of hospitalisations between the estimated
total hospitalisations and the observed data. Panel 4 The difference in
daily growth (number of daily hospitalisations) between the estimated
and observed epidemic curves."
